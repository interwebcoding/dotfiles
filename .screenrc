# Notes
# -----
# 1. Modified to work with Emacs: C-t is the action command, not C-a. 
# 2. To change the colors of the hardstatus line, change this line: 
#       sorendition "+b +kG"  
#    Example: blue (+b) highlight with black text (k) on a green background (G)
#    Example: sorendition "+r +kG"  is red highlighting with black text on a green background

## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## -- 2) Hardstatus line (aka navigation bar at bottom) 
##       and sorendition (aka color scheme for navigation bar)
## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2.1) sorendition = color scheme
#      Set the colors for the "messages" and "text marking"
#      Example: "+b kG" = blue screen, black text, green background. Change
#      to "+b kR" and so on to distinguish machines.
sorendition "+b kG"   

# 2.2) hardstatus = navigation bar @ bottom
hardstatus alwayslastline "%H %-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%<"  

# 2.3) Autoload two screen tabs for emacs/bash.
screen -t bash 1

# 2.4) Description of the keywords used in hardstatus
# caption always "%?%F%{-b bc}%:%{-b bb}%?%C|%D|%M %d|%H%?%F%{+u wb}%? %L=%-Lw%45>%{+b by}%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%-0<"
# 
# Anything I don't describe is treated literally.
# 
# %?          - Start of a conditional statement.
#  %F         - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus (i.e. it
#               is the only window or the currently active one).
#  %{-b bc}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, cyan background.
# %:          - else
#  %{-b bb}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, blue background (this obscures
#               the text on non-focused windows and just gives a blue line).
# %?          - End conditional statement.
#  %C         - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 12 hour format
#  %D         - Three-letter day-of-week appreviation
#  %M         - Three-letter month appreviation
#  %d         - Day of the month
#  %H         - hostname
#  %?         - Start of conditional statement.
#   %F        - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus.
#   %{+u wb}  - underlined, white foreground, blue background
#  %?         - End conditional (if not focused, text remaind blue on blue).
#    %L=      - truncation/padding point.  With the 'L' qualifier, basically
#               just acts as a reference point.  Further truncation/padding is
#               done relative to here, not the beginning of the string
#    %-Lw     - window list up to but not including the current window (-),
#               show window flags (L)
#    %45>     - truncation/padding marker; place this point about 45% of the
#               way into the display area (45)
#    %{+b by} - add bold (still underlined from before), blue foreground,
#               yellow background
#      %n     - number of the current window
#      %f     - flags for current window
#      %t     - title of current window
#    %{-}     - undo last color change (so now we're back to underlined white
#               on blue)  (technically, this is a pop; a second invocation
#               would drop things back to unadorned blue on cyan)
#    %+Lw     - window list from the next window on (-), show window flags (L)
#    %-0<     - truncation/padding point.  Place this point zero spaces (0)
#               from the right margin (-).

# Bind F11 and F12 (NOT F1 and F2) to previous and next screen window
bindkey -k F1 prev
bindkey -k F2 next

# Don't block command output if the terminal stops responding

# Enable 256-color mode when screen is started with TERM=xterm-256color
# Taken from: http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/

# Note that TERM != "xterm-256color" within a screen window. Rather it is
# "screen" or "screen-bce"

# terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal
# allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
